What's been done so far:


- met data from NASA/chirps (getMetData.R)

- apsim simulation:
  - experiment design in factorial component
  - sowing rule reads Baseline_with_SM.csv for crop & sowing date

- analysis
  - basic phenology plots (readApsimOutputs.R)


to do:
 - observed meteostation data
 - most years are missing from exp. design
 - soils added to each station 
 - agronomy management (geometry, N, cultivars, ...)
